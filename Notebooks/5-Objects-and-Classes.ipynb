    "  - **Behavior** (methods / functions)\n",
    "\n",

    "- An **object** is a **specific instance** of a class.\n",

    "#### Attributes\n",
    "- **Attributes** are variables that store data related to an object.\n",
    "- They represent the **properties** or **identifiers** of each instance of a class.\n",

    "- They describe the **actions** or **behavior** of an object.\n",
