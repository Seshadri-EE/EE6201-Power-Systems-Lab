    "### Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes without explicitly copying data. Instead of manually expanding a smaller array to match a larger one (which wastes memory), NumPy automatically \"stretches\" the smaller array to be compatible with the larger one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does Broadcasting work?**: \n",
    "When NumPy operates on two arrays, it compares their shapes element-wise, starting from the rightmost (trailing) dimension.\n",
    "1. Dimension Alignment: If the arrays do not have the same number of dimensions (ndim), NumPy prepends 1s to the left of the smaller shape until both have the same ndim.\n",
    "2. Compatibility Check: Two dimensions are compatible if:\n",
    "   * They are equal, OR\n",
    "   * One of them is 1.\n",
    "3. The \"Stretch\": If a dimension is 1, NumPy treats the data as if it were copied along that dimension to match the larger array's size (without actually using extra memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Scenarios & Examples\n",
    "A. **1D Array and a Scalar:** The simplest form of broadcasting. The scalar is broadcast across every element of the vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. **2D Array and a Scalar:** The scalar is broadcast across every row and every column of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "C. **2D Array and a 1D Vector**: If the shapes are $(M, N)$ and $(1, N)$: The vector is broadcast across every row. If the shapes are $(M, N)$ and $(M, 1)$: The vector is broadcast across every column."

    "*Ways to Specify Bins*\n",
    "1. Integer: `bins=10` — NumPy automatically creates 10 equal-width bins between the minimum and maximum value.\n",
    "2. Sequence: `bins=[0, 0.9, 1.1, 1.5]` — You manually define the edges of the bins. This is useful for grouping \"Undervoltage,\" \"Normal,\" and \"Overvoltage\" regions.\n",

    "|-----------|------------|----------------|---------------|\n",

    "| `range`  | The lower and upper range of the bins. Values outside this range are ignored. | `np.histogram(data, range=(0.9, 1.1))` | `(counts, bin_edges)` |\n",
