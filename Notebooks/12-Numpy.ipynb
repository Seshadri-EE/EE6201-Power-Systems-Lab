    "\n",
    "Standard Python lists are versatile but slow for heavy mathematical lifting. NumPy introduces the ndarray (n-dimensional array), which offers several critical advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Homogeneity:** Unlike lists, all elements in a NumPy array must be of the same type (typically float or int). This allows the computer to store data in a continuous block of memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectorization & Performance:** NumPy operations are implemented in C under the hood, allowing for \"vectorized\" operations that avoid the overhead of Python loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Indexing:** It supports complex slicing, boolean masking, and multi-dimensional indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory Efficiency:** NumPy arrays consume significantly less memory compared to Python lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importing the library:** To use NumPy, we must first import the library. The standard convention in the scientific community is to alias it as `np`."

    "\n",
    "**Slicing and Striding:** The syntax is `start:stop:step`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`x[1:5]:` Elements from index 1 to 4.\n",

    "`x[0, :]:` Extracts the first row (e.g., all phases of Bus 1).\n",

    "\n",
    "* *1D Array x indexed by 1D integer array a:* x[a] returns an array where each element is x[a_i].\n",
