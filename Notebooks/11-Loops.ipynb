    "### Introduction to Looping\n",
    "Looping is a fundamental programming concept used to execute a same block of code multiple times. Instead of writing the same line of code repeatedly, we use loops to automate repetitive tasks, such as iterating through all buses in a power grid or performing iterative calculations like load flow."
