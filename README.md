# EE6201: Power Systems Laboratory

## Course Overview
EE6201: Power Systems Laboratory is designed to develop practical computational skills for analyzing power systems. 

The course begins with an introduction to **programming fundamentals using Python**, enabling students to build a strong foundation in scientific computing. Building on this foundation, students progressively develop their own code for core power system analysis tools, including:

- Load flow analysis for transmission and distribution systems  
- Short-circuit analysis  
- Power system state estimation  
- (Time permitting) transient and electromagnetic transient (EMTP) studies  

While students are introduced to commonly used commercial and open-source power system software packages, the **primary emphasis is on developing in-house algorithms and implementations**. 

The theoretical background required for these topics is drawn from and reinforced through **EE5200: Steady State Power System Analysis**, with key concepts reviewed as needed throughout the course.

## Purpose of These Notebooks
These notebooks are designed for **quick review and guided practice** of Python programming concepts relevant to power system analysis. They cover:

- Python syntax, data types, and control structures  
- Functions and modules  
- Basic arithmetic and data operations  
- Libraries commonly used in power system studies (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)

> **Note:** These notebooks are **not a complete Python reference**. Students are encouraged to refer to the official Python documentation for a more comprehensive understanding.

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Jupyter Lab**.  
2. Read the Markdown cells for theory.  
3. Run code cells to see examples and experiment with modifications.
